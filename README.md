Gameplay Video Sampler is a tool designed to process and edit gameplay footage automatically. It was created as a fun project to streamline the editing process and make it easier to share exciting gameplay moments with friends.

## Description

Just created this as a fun project since we had so many gameplay clips with my friends. I got interested in editing, but I am too lazy. Instead, I just created a system that will edit for meâ€”that's why I created this. It's not that good; I just stopped developing it until I reached the video result that I wanted, covering the removal of boring parts, gameplay focus, and moments only.

Some of the choices are redundant, so maybe continuing with trial and error is better.

## Features

### Smart Sampling

- Automatically removes boring parts of the footage.


### Highlight Compilation

- Focuses on gameplay highlights and significant moments.


### Customization Options

- Remove Boring Parts
- Gameplay Focus
- Moments Only


### Advanced Settings

- **GPU Acceleration** (In Testing): Uses GPU for faster processing, but may fail sometimes.
- **CPU Processing**: Fallback to CPU if GPU fails.
- **Debug Mode**: Exports a sample of the video to test if the system works on your computer.


## Export Modes

- **Automatic**: Compiles all highlights into one clip. For example, a 1-hour clip might be cut down to 20-30 minutes.
- **Fixed Clip Length**: Set the length of each clip. If there are more interesting clips, they will be exported in multiple parts.
- **Controlled Fixed Length**: Set a specific length and amount for more controlled exports.


## Supported Game Types

This tool covers most games we play, including:

- FPS
- Horror
- MMORPG

- Casual


## Timeline

The timeline feature ensures the system is running correctly.

## Media Extensions

The system may not work on all media extensions.
